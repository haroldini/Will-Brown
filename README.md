# Will-Brown

## A multiplayer online game built with React.js and TypeScript with Firebase authentication and a NoSQL Firestore database.

## WIP

## Current functionality:

### Users can create accounts using email and password. Remember-me and password-reset functionality. Fully reactive but mobile first UI. Loading spinner present during authentication and component loading. Users can create a team by shuffling and claiming generated team members with random names and stats, which is stored in a Firestore document allocated to their UUID.
